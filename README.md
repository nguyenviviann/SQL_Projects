# Welcome to My SQL Project Repository!

I am quite familiar with SQL and have learned a lot through hands-on practice. This repository is where I’ll be showcasing my progress with each new project I complete. 

There’s always more to learn, so any constructive feedback is welcome!

Have fun exploring :)
